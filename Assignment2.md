In this assignment we learn how to assess rates from a binomial distribution, using the case of assessing your teachers’ knowledge of CogSci
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

N.B. there is a second part at the bottom for next week.

### First part

You want to assess your teachers’ knowledge of cognitive science. “These
guys are a bunch of drama(turgist) queens, mindless philosophers,
chattering communication people and Russian spies. Do they really know
CogSci?”, you think.

To keep things simple (your teachers should not be faced with too
complicated things): - You created a pool of equally challenging
questions on CogSci - Each question can be answered correctly or not (we
don’t allow partially correct answers, to make our life simpler). -
Knowledge of CogSci can be measured on a scale from 0 (negative
knowledge, all answers wrong) through 0.5 (random chance) to 1 (awesome
CogSci superpowers)

This is the data: - Riccardo: 3 correct answers out of 6 questions -
Kristian: 2 correct answers out of 2 questions (then he gets bored) -
Josh: 160 correct answers out of 198 questions (Josh never gets bored) -
Mikkel: 66 correct answers out of 132 questions

Questions:

1.  What’s Riccardo’s estimated knowledge of CogSci? What is the
    probability he knows more than chance (0.5) \[try figuring this out.
    if you can’t peek into chapters 3.1 and 3.2 and/or the slides\]?

-   First implement a grid approximation (hint check paragraph 2.4.1!)
    with a uniform prior, calculate the posterior and plot the results

``` r
set.seed(8) #for reproducibility


n <- 101 #setting length of grid
n_success <- 3 #setting number of correct questions
n_trials  <- 6 #setting number of questions in total

#grid approximation for Riccardo
(
  Ric_tib <-
    tibble(p_grid     = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = n), #setting p_grid
           # note we're using a flat uniform prior
           prior      = 1) %>%  #setting prior
    mutate(likelihood = dbinom(n_success, size = n_trials, prob = p_grid)) %>% #computing likelihood              using dbinom
    mutate(posterior  = (likelihood * prior) / sum(likelihood * prior)) #computing posterior using                Bayes
)
```

``` r
#Computing the probability that Riccardo's knowledge is above chance
Ric_tib %>%  filter(p_grid >.5) %>% 
  summarise(sum = sum(posterior)) #summing the probability of each possible value of p (proportion of cogsci knowledge above 0.5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##     sum

    ## 1 0.489

-   Then implement a quadratic approximation (hint check paragraph
    2.4.2!).
-   N.B. for the rest of the exercise just keep using the grid
    approximation (we’ll move to quadratic approximations in two
    classes)

``` r
set.seed(8)

#Quadratic approximation

globe_qa <-
  rethinking::map(
    alist(
      c ~ dbinom(6, p),  # binomial likelihood 6 = number of questions
      p ~ dunif(0, 1)    # uniform prior
    ), 
    data = list(c = 3)) #3 = number of correct questions

precis(globe_qa) #obtaining summary of quadratic approximation
```

    ##   Mean StdDev 5.5% 94.5%
    ## p  0.5    0.2 0.17  0.83

``` r
#Plotting grid approximation against quadratic approximation
n_grid <- 101 #defining length of grid

tibble(p_grid                  = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = n_grid),
       prior                   = 1,
       c                       = 3, #correct questions
       n                       = 6, #questions in total
       m                       = 0.5, #mean from precis
       s                       = 0.2) %>% #SD form precis

1.  Estimate all the teachers’ knowledge of CogSci. Who’s best? Use grid
    approximation. Comment on the posteriors of Riccardo and Mikkel.

``` r
#creating tibble of teacher data
teachers <- tibble(Teacher = c("Riccardo", "Kristian", "Josh", "Mikkel"),
                   Correct = c(3,2,160,66),
                   Questions = c(6,2,198,132))
```

2a. Produce plots of the prior, and posterior for each teacher.

1.  Change the prior. Given your teachers have all CogSci jobs, you
    should start with a higher appreciation of their knowledge: the
    prior is a normal distribution with a mean of 0.8 and a standard
    deviation of 0.2. Do the results change (and if so how)? 3a. Produce
    plots of the prior and posterior for each teacher.

``` r
set.seed(8)

res1 <- grid_function(teachers, 1001, 1e4, dnorm(seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 1001), 0.8, 0.2)) #specifying new normally distributed prior

hdi_df <- get_hdi(res1$samples)

1.  You go back to your teachers and collect more data (multiply the
    previous numbers by 100). Calculate their knowledge with both a
    uniform prior and a normal prior with a mean of 0.8 and a standard
    deviation of 0.2. Do you still see a difference between the results?
    Why?

``` r
teachers2 <- tibble(Teacher = c("Riccardo", "Kristian", "Josh", "Mikkel")) %>% #creating new tibble of teacher data
  mutate(Correct = c(3,2,160,66)*100, #multiplying previous correct questions by 100
         Questions = c(6,2,198,132)*100) #multiplying previous questions by 100

1.  Imagine you’re a skeptic and think your teachers do not know
    anything about CogSci, given the content of their classes. How would
    you operationalize that belief?

``` r
set.seed(8)

res1 <- grid_function(teachers, 1001, 1e4, dnorm(seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 1001), 0.5, 0.05)) #specifying skeptic normally distributed prior

1.  Optional question: Can you estimate the difference between
    Riccardo’s estimated knowledge and that of each of the other
    teachers? Would you deem it credible (that is, would you believe
    that it is actually different)?

2.  Bonus knowledge: all the stuff we have done can be implemented in a
    lme4-like fashion using the brms package. Here is an example.

``` r
# library(brms)
# 
# d <- data.frame(
#   Correct=c(3,2,160,66),
#   Questions=c(6,2,198,132),
#   Teacher=c("RF","KT","JS","MW"))
# 
# # Model sampling only from the prior (for checking the predictions your prior leads to)
# FlatModel_priorCheck <- brm(Correct|trials(Questions) ~ 1, 
#                  data = subset(d, Teacher=="RF"),
#                  prior = prior("uniform(0,1)", class = "Intercept"),
#                  family = binomial,

#                                    class = "Intercept"),

# plot(SkepticalModel)
```

If you dare, try to tweak the data and model to test two hypotheses: -
Is Kristian different from Josh? - Is Josh different from chance?

### Second part: Focusing on predictions

Last year you assessed the teachers (darned time runs quick!). Now you
want to re-test them and assess whether your models are producing
reliable predictions. In Methods 3 we learned how to do machine-learning
style assessment of predictions (e.g. rmse on testing datasets).
Bayesian stats makes things a bit more complicated. So we’ll try out how
that works. N.B. You can choose which prior to use for the analysis of
last year’s data.

Questions to be answered (but see guidance below): 1- Write a paragraph
discussing how assessment of prediction performance is different in
Bayesian vs. frequentist models 2- Provide at least one plot and one
written line discussing prediction errors for each of the teachers.

This is the old data: - Riccardo: 3 correct answers out of 6 questions -
Kristian: 2 correct answers out of 2 questions (then he gets bored) -
Josh: 160 correct answers out of 198 questions (Josh never gets bored) -
Mikkel: 66 correct answers out of 132 questions

This is the new data: - Riccardo: 9 correct answers out of 10 questions
(then he freaks out about teaching preparation and leaves) - Kristian: 8
correct answers out of 12 questions - Josh: 148 correct answers out of
172 questions (again, Josh never gets bored) - Mikkel: 34 correct
answers out of 65 questions

Guidance Tips

``` r
teachers_new <- #creating tibble of teacher data
  tibble(Teacher = c("Riccardo", "Kristian", "Josh", "Mikkel"),
                   Correct = c(9,8,148,34),
                   Questions = c(10,12,172,65))
```

1.  There are at least two ways of assessing predictions.
2.  Last year’s results are this year’s expectations.

1.  Are the parameter estimates changing? (way 1)

1.  How does the new data look in last year’s predictive posterior?
    (way 2)

``` r
#apparently we don't want to do this?? Why??
